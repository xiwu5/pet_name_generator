Part 1 - Setup

1. Clone the Pet Name Generator Repo
2. Create your venv
3. Install your `requirements.txt`
4. Create a database in psql called `pet_name_gen_dev`
5. Create your `.env` file and add `pet_name_gen_dev` as the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.
6. Run your `flask db init` and `flask db upgrade`
7. If you want, check your database to make sure it has the `pet` relation

Part 2 - Install the Gemini API package (refer to Learn)

1. Install the Gemini API python library
2. Run the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to add Gemini to the `requirements.txt` file
3. Add your Gemini Secret key to your `.env` file
4. Import `genai` into your `pet_routes.py` file
5. Create an Gemini client in your `pet_routes.py` file

Part 3 - Write Your Pet Name POST Route
	
1. Now that everything is set up and Gemini has been installed, write a helper function that will take the correct parameters to generate a suggestion for a pet’s name given its species, color and personality. 
2. Work with your group to write a prompt to feed into the Gemini API that will generate a name for your pet with the parameters given. Feel free to test out a few prompts and make sure to use print statements to analyze the response you get from each. 
3. Once you’ve got a working prompt and feel satisfied with your understanding of the response, write the add_pet function to add a pet to the database. Your request body should only include the pet’s species (type), personality and color. The name should be generated using AI and then added to the Pet object which then gets sent to the database. Remember that you may have to tweak the string you receive in order to effectively add it to the Pet object.  

Part 4 - (Optional) Write a PATCH Route 

If you have completed the steps up to this point, try adding a route that allows you to request a different name for a specific pet. It’s up to you how you want to achieve this, but see if you are able to tweak your earlier helper method to make this possible. Once the AI suggests a new name, update the name in the database.
